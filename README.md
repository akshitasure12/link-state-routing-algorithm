# Link State Routing Algorithm

This method uses the term link state to define the characteristic of a link (an edge) that represents a network in the internet. In this algorithm the cost associated with an edge defines the state of the link. Links with lower costs are preferred to links with higher costs; if the cost of a link is infinity, it means that the link does not exist or has been broken.

## Features to be Implemented:

1. Discovery of nodes via Hello packets
2. Network-wide synchronization of topology information using a Flooding mechanism.
3. Shortest Path Routing Table Construction (Djkshtra's Algorithm)
4. Graphical/Animated Network Visualization
